# Text-Based RPG
A text-based RPG (role-playing game) created in March 2020. The game is coded entirely in Java. \
There is little content and no story -- the game is barely a game. All there is to do is to fight increasingly strong enemies and watch your stats grow.

#### There is no save functionality. Closing the console resets your progress: be careful! ####

## Gameplay
Enemies drop experience points (XP) and money (gold), both of which are used to grow your stats. \
Once you have accrued enough experience points, you will level up and enjoy an increase in stats. \
Gold is used in the store to purchase stat upgrades. You can visit the store with `S`.

Enter `W` to restore health points (HP) when out of combat. \
If the current enemy is too hard to beat, enter `R` to go back to fighting the easiest enemies and accrue more XP and gold.

If you want, you can edit the enemies' stats and drops in `src/Main.java`.

# Build and Run Instructions
Build the project first, then run `src/Main.java`. I used IntelliJ for this.
