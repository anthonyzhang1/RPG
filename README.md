# A Text-Based RPG written in Java
A text-based RPG I made in my free time during my second year of college. It's pretty barebones, but it's nice to look back at.
There is no real objective in this game, other than fighting stronger and stronger enemies, and watching your stats grow.

#### There is no save functionality. Closing the console resets your progress: be careful! ####

Leveling up by fighting weaker enemies is a necessity in this game. You can refight previously slain enemies with `R`.\
HP is not restored after battle, but you can restore 10% of your lost HP with `W` outside of battle.\
There is a shop to purchase stat boosts with gold! You can enter the shop with `S`.

If you want, you can skip the grind by editing the enemies' stats in `src/Main.java` so that they will drop a ridiculous amount of XP.

# Build and Run Instructions
I used IntelliJ to build this program. Build the project first, then run `src/Main.java`.
